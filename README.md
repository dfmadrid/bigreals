bigReals
========

node.js native c/c++ addon using [gmp](http://gmplib.org/) and [mpfr](http://www.mpfr.org/) to perform fast, infinite precision,
loop-optimized calculations and bit manipulations over big integers and big irrationals numbers.

In a nutshell, bigReals offers the following features:

    * Easy and fast modular arithmetics.
    * Comprehensive trigonometric, exponentiation and logarithm functions.
    * Special numbers support(NaN, Infinity, Pi, Euler's and Catalan's constants ...).
    * Loop optimized functions to speed up calculation from Javascript.
    * Precision of irrationals calculations is chosen based on the highest between the operand's precision if none is provided as argument.

bigReals is the addon used by [cryptatoo](https://github.com/dfmadrid/cryptatoo) to perform cryptographic analysis and attacks over
large numbers like RSA keys of 1024 bits. bigReals is a work in progress, currently integer and irrationals support is fully operational but
new functions and improvements will be added in future versions.

Installation
------------
bigReals has been tested on Linux, but should compile and work fine in Windows or Mac provided [gmp](http://gmplib.org/) and
[mpfr](http://www.mpfr.org) sources are installed. To install gmp's sources on Ubuntu Linux:

    $ sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev

If you run a linux distribution, is quite likely you already have installed mpfr in your system, you could check it with the
following command:

    $ locate mpfr.h

While a npm package is created, you can install bigReals cloning from github:

    $ cd node_modules
    $ git clone git://github.com/dfmadrid/bigreals.git
    $ cd bigreals
    $ npm install

Testing
-------
A complete battery of tests is included under directory test. To run all tests, execute npm test:

    $ npm test

To run a specific test, execute it with node:

    $ node test/modular

Documentation
-------------
Documentation will follow soon. Meanwhile, check tests for guiding about usage.

Examples
--------
Normal and modular arithmetics:

    var bigReal = require('bigreals');
    
    var op1 = bigReal(20);
    var op2 = bigReal(30);
    var mod = bigReal(3);

    console.log(op1.add(op2).toString());       // 20 + 30 = 50
    console.log(op1.mul(2, mod).toString());    // 20 * 2 mod 3 = 1

Integer roots with or without remainder:

    var bigReal = require('bigreals');
    
    var op = bigReal(30);
    var mod = bigReal(3);
    var remainder = bigReal(1);
    console.log(op.root(3).toString());        // 30 ^ 1/3 = 3 (truncated)
    var result = op.root(remainder, 3);             // 30 ^ 1/3 = 3
    console.log(remainder.add(result.pow(3)).toString());  // 3 + 3 ^ 3 = 30

Hash table creation and lookup using special loop-optimized functions:

    var bigReal = require('bigreals');
    
    var op1 = bigReal(20);
    var op2 = bigReal(30);
    var op3 = bigReal("500");
    var hashTable = {};
    var cont = 0;

    while(cont < 100){
     hashTable[op1.accMul(3).toString(16)] = op2.sub(op3).toString();    // op1.accMul(3) -> op1 = op1 * 3;
     cont++;
     }

    cont = 0;
    var value = "21d20f70b1835f3560511394";

    while(cont < 100){
     if(hashTable[value]){
      console.log(hashTable[value]);                // Value of hash 21d20f70b1835f3560511394 is -470
	    cont = 100;
	}
      cont++;
    }

If you have any idea, performance improvement or function missing particularly related to cryptography or number theory that
would be interesting to have included in bigReals, send an email to &lt;david.fdmv@gmail.com&gt; or open a pull request in
Github. If you find a bug, please open an issue on Github with the steps to reproduce it.
