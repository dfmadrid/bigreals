###<a name="about">About bigReals</a>

bigReals is a node.js native addon written in C/C++ using GNU's [gmp](http://www.gmp.org) and [mpfr](http://www.mpfr.org) arithmetic
libraries for infinite/multi precision fast calculations over big integers and irrationals numbers. Both *gmp* and *mpfr* are state-of-the-art
libraries in performance with most of its functions implemented in assembly language. bigReals focuses in improving the usability and speed of
calculations with the libraries from node.js, adding some special functions to improve performance or add new functionalities.

###<a name="compatibility">Compatibility</a>

BigReals has been tested with *gmp* version 5.0.5 and *mpfr* version 4.0 in Ubuntu Linux 64bits, but should compile and work in other systems,
either 32 or 64bits in Windows, Linux or Apple platforms.

If you find problems or bugs compiling or using bigReals in other systems or with other versions of *gmp* or *mpfr* installed, please open an
issue in GitHub's [bigReals project repository](https://github.com/dfmadrid/bigreals).

A bigReals integer could be compared with a long integer or another bigReals integer with the **cmp** function, which will return 0 if both numbers
are equal, >0 if the argument is smaller or <0 if bigger:

    var bigReals = require('bigreals').integers;

    var op1 = bigReals(9);
    var op2 = bigReals(12);
    
    console.log(op1.cmp(9));
    console.log(op2.cmp(op1));
    console.log(op1.cmp(op2);

###<a name="basics">Basic usage</a>

BigReals combo functions execute several calculations in C/C++ before returning the result to NodeJS, which results in fast calculations mainly
targeted to be executed inside loops. Besides that, all combo functions will add the result of the calculation to the existing value of the
bigReals integer. Current combo functions in bigReals are **addMul**, **subMul** and **accMul**. All the functions allow an optional long
integer or bigReals integer modulus for modular calculations:

    var bigReals = require('bigreals').integers;

    var op1 = bigReals(9);
    var op2 = bigReals(12);
    var modulus = bigReals(3);

    console.log(op1.addMul(9));			// op1 = op1 + op1 * 9
    console.log(op1.addMul(9, modulus));    	// op1 = op1 + op1 * 9 mod 3 
    console.log(op2.subMul(3));         	// op2 = op2 - op2 * 3
    console.log(op1.accMul(op2, modulus);   	// op1 = op1 * op2 mod 3

In future versions, combo functions will allow to specify a maximum value a bigReal integer could have to avoid reallocation of memory in executions
inside loops, speeding up the calculation even more.

To obtain a string representing the bigReals integer, function **toString** could be used with an optinal string base between 2 and 62
as argument. If no base is provided, base 10 is assumed:


    var bigReals = require('bigreals').integers;

    var op1 = bigReals("ded4b562a4e56432de5", 16);
 
    console.log(op1.toString());
    console.log("Value of op1 is = " + op1);	// toString() will called explictly by Javascript/NodeJS
    console.log(op1.toString(16));

When you inspect a bigReals integer with console log, an object with a string representing the number in base 10 will be obtained:
 
    var bigReals = require('bigreals').integers;

    var op1 = bigReals("ded4b562a4e56432de5", 16);
 
    console.log(op1);
